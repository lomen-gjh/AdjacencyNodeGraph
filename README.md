# AdjecencyNodeGraph
Graph implementation using adjecency nodes. 
For now we have:
1. Graph class
2. Node class
3. Graphic implementation
4. Adding node by clicking
5. Connectiong nodes
6. Deleting nodes
7. Priority Queue for Adjecency Nodes
Fixed issues: pqindex sync, heapifydown
Possible improvements: Graph.nodes can be remade as Hashmap rather than vector.
